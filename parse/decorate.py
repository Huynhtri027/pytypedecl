"""Allows "decorating" the classes of a nested tree.

Allows changing classes in a tree to ones with more functionality, by returning
a new tree with nodes that were reconstructed using the newer class.

Usage:

  # "decorate" is, essentially, a map that collects all classes it decorates.
  # Needed since we don't want different decorators conflicting.
  decorate = Decorator()

  @decorate
  class ClassType(pytd.ClassType):

  @decorate
  class BasicType(pytd.BasicType):

      ...

  node = decorate.Visit(node)
